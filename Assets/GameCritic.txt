1. The game is extraordinarily easy. To the point where you can AFK it, and still win with absolutly no challange.
2. It would be pretty difficult to make it easier, you can also just put the colored balls in front the post to make it easier. But there are a multitude of 
ways to make it more difficult. You could add more balls you need to score, or have something that could give you a game over.
3.Textures would be one of the biggest wow factors it can get, there could also be some interesting mechanics that could also give it a wow factor.
4. I don't think this is a great game, there are multitude of things that could be improved on to make it more fun and interesting. I also don't think the 
game is very tedious as it takes very little time to complete.
